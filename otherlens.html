<p>We are a website dedicated to improving awareness of visual disabilities. The three visual disabilities that we focus on are Colorblindness, Cataracts, and Glaucoma. Visual disabilities affect a large portion of the global population. However, many people are not aware of these disabilities, and often, there are many misconceptions. Our website aims to answer these questions and grow awareness of visual disabilities and how they affect those who have them.</p>

        <h2>About Otherlens: Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At otherlens, we want people to what the world looks like through, well, other lenses! We want to raise awareness on how people with different visual disabilities see the world. By doing this, not only are we clearing up misconceptions about visual disabilties, but we are giving people a vessel to reach people with visual disabilities, and help raise awareness. For example, artists can use our website to create artworks reaching out to the visually disabled or raise awarness through their art. </p>

    <h2>Glaucoma</h2>
    <p>Our eyes are constantly creating a liqud called the 'aqeous humour'. As new liquid flows into
        our eyes, the old liquid usually drains out, through an area called the 'drainage angle'. This process keeps our
        eye pressure stable, allowing our eyes to function properly. If the drainage angle
        is not working correctly, it creates a fluid buildup, which increases the pressure inside the eye, ultimately
        damaging the optic nerve. As the nerve fibers within the optic nerve die out, it affects tehe quality of the
        vision, blinding more and more areas out. </p>

         <h2>Colorblindness</h2>
        <p>Those with colorblindness see colors different than those without it.Colorblindness makes it hard to tell the
            difference between certain colors. Within our eyes, there are different types off cells called rods and
            cones which detect light. Cone cells are the ones which help us distinguish different colors. Color
            blindness occurs when when one or more cone cells are absent. The severity of the colorblindness depends on
            the amount of cone cells missing. There are three different degrees of colorblindness. Some people with mild
            color blindness usually see colors in good lighting, but struggle to see colors in dimmer or worse lighting.
            Others cannot tell apart certain colors, such as red, green and blue, in any light. The most severe degree
            of color blindness is when a person sees everything in gray. However, this is uncommon. </p>

        <h2>Cataracts</h2>

        <p>One of the most important parts of our eyes that lets us see is the lens. Cataracts make these lens cloudy,
            impairing our vision. As we grow older, the proteins in our eyes start breaking down and clumping up, clouding up the lens, and causing cataracts. Cataracts make your vision blurry, cloudy, and less colorful. These impaired lenses can
            sometimes also lead to issues with light sensitivity. Below is an image which shows the difference between a
            healthy lens and a cataract lens. </p>
