<p>We are a website dedicated to improving awareness of visual disabilities. The three visual disabilities that we focus on are color blindness, Cataracts, and Glaucoma as these conditions are the most common among those visually impaired. Visual disabilities affect a large portion of the global population. However, many people are not aware of these disabilities, and often, there are many misconceptions. Our website aims to answer these questions and grow awareness of visual disabilities and how they affect people living with them.</p>

        <h2>About Otherlens: Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At Otherlens, we want people to experience what the world looks like through, well, other lenses! We want to raise awareness of how people with different visual disabilities see the world. By doing this, not only are we clearing up misconceptions about visual disabilities, but we are giving people a vessel to reach people with visual disabilities, and help raise awareness. For example, artists can use our website to create artwork reaching out to the visually disabled or raise awareness through their art. </p>

    <h2>Glaucoma</h2>
    <p>Our eyes are constantly creating a liquid called the 'aqueous humor'. As new liquid flows into
        our eyes, the old liquid usually drains out, through an area called the 'drainage angle'. This process keeps our
        eye pressure stable, allowing our eyes to function properly. Those with Glaucoma do not have properly functioning drainage angles, thus creating a fluid buildup. This increases the pressure inside the eye, ultimately
        damaging the optic nerve. As the nerve fibers within the optic nerve die out, it affects the quality of the
        vision, thus blinding more and more areas out. </p>

         <h2>Color Blindness</h2>
        <p>Those with color blindness see colors different than those without it. Color blindness makes it hard to tell the
            difference between certain colors. Within our eyes, there are different types of cells called rods and
            cones that detect light. Cone cells are the ones that help us distinguish different colors. Color
            blindness occurs when one or more cone cells are absent. The severity of the color blindness depends on
            the amount of cone cells missing. There are three different degrees of color blindness. Some people with mild
            color blindness usually see colors in good lighting, but struggle to see colors in dimmer or worse lighting.
            Others cannot tell apart certain colors, such as red, green, and blue, in any light. A person with the highest degree of color blindess see everything in gray. However, this is uncommon. </p>

        <h2>Cataracts</h2>

        <p>One of the most important parts of our eyes that lets us see is the lens. Cataracts make these lenses cloudy,
            impairing our vision. As we grow older, the proteins in our eyes start breaking down and clumping up, clouding up the lens, and causing Cataracts. A person with Cataracts sees things as blurry, cloudy, and less colorful. These impaired lenses can
            sometimes also lead to issues with light sensitivity. Below is an image that shows the difference between a
            healthy lens and a Cataract lens. </p>
